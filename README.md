# 3starunitcalculator
Calculate the odds of hitting a 3-star unit with different parameters.

Current functionality updates list:
 - Rewrite to include 1, 2 or 4 costs for 3 star probabilities. 5 costs are irrelevant.
 - Modulate functions and parameters into odds.py with class for future updates
 - Add in parameter for opponents griefing your units
 - Consider edge cases of multiple people holding multiple units of different costs, although I am not sure how the shop functions if there are no more 2 costs and it rolls a 2 cost in that slot\
 - Calculate a probability using gold
 - Dynamically update based on user input for level (shop odds change per level)
 - ~~Rewrite to add in simulation number~~
